# Multi-Chamber-Soft-Actuator-Mathematical-Model

The following project is auxiliary content for the publication "Mathematical Modeling of a Multi-Chamber Pneumatic Soft Actuator" found in: https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0825/11/8/221. Its is a matlab simulation for the position and shape of a soft actuator derived from its physical composition as well as the input value.

Two main input values where simulated, being pressure if using a pressure limitting system or time when using a constant air flux.

Furthermore the change in different physical attributes was also simulated taking into consideration variables such as chamber height, wall thickness, segment separation, material composition and pneumatic chamber geometry.

All files can be used by changing the intitial variables to those that are going to be simulated.
